                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <h5><strong>Salsabila Anandita Putri</strong><br><strong>12310035</strong><br><strong>PPLG
                        X3</strong><br><strong>Cicurug 9</strong></h5>
                <p><strong>About Me:</strong><br>My hobby is listening to Taylor Swift's music. I like all of her songs.
                    Besides Taylor, I also enjoy Nadin Amizah's songs. Maybe all of her songs are my favorites, but the
                    ones I listen to most frequently are 'Taruh,' 'Beranjak Dewasa,' and 'Sorai'; they're really
                    enjoyable. I'm also a fan of the idol group JKT48, yes, I'm a wota who follows them on social media.
                    I love listening to their songs and watching their Showrooms or theater performances. Their songs
                    may not be everyone's cup of tea, but if you're a wota, you'll definitely like them. My favorite
                    members (oshi) are many: Zee, Marsha, Muthe, Christy, Shani.<br>
                    Apart from music, I also watch Ghibli movies. Almost all of them have been watched, and 'When Marnie
                    Was There' is the best because of its plot twist. There are probably many other good ones, but
                    that's about it.
                    <br>
                    I was born in 2008 and live with both of my parents and my family in Cigombong. I'm the youngest of
                    four siblings, with two older brothers and one older sister. Besides music, what I like the most is
                    probably the sky; 'the sky is beautiful, isn't it,' they say. Besides the sky, I also like outer
                    space and planets; they're just so cool.
